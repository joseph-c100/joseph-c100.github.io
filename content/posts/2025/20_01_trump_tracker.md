I coded the highly popular Trump approval tracker page for The Economist which as of writing is receiving hundreds of thousdands of views each day.

The page started by monitoring the first 100 days of Trump's presidency as well as a breakdown of his favourability rating but then switched to a more in-dept approval rating tracker that breaks down his ratings by issue, by state and by demographic.
