Interested in EFVS displays (Enhanced Flight Vision Systems) and their use of an interface that is conformal to the scene around it - i.e. elements displayed are exactly in the right position relative to the real world. The interface is contextual, is aware of the pilot's peripheral vision, does not limit the pilot to completely rely on it and only shows specific information in a dense space.

It made me think how an interface such as this can be used in day to day activities. I started breaking down the EFVS visual components, separating them out and bringing them back together in different forms - as a sort of graphic exercise.

I thought it would make an interesting experimental typeface using each visual element to represent a letter.
