Over the weekend I turned an old Dell Optiplex 5050 into a home server running Linux Mint. I set up Docker containers for PostGIS and PGAdmin to host and explore large geospatial datasets without eating up laptop storage. 

I configured it with Tailscale for remote access from anywhere, and when I SSH in, it displays a custom banner (I named the server 'Odell' after the Dell hardware).
